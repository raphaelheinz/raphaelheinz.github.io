Hi, I'm Raphael. Since I completed my **Master‚Äôs** in **Computer Science**, I have gained several years of professional experience in **software engineering, machine learning, and computer vision**. I specialize in designing and implementing high-performance applications across platforms. My expertise spans **full-stack development** including both **backend** and **frontend technologies**. Additionally, I research **machine learning algorithms**, focusing on advanced image processing techniques, feature extraction methods, and explainable AI.


#### üíª Experience
- **Backend implementation** and **API development**, primarily using Java
- Researching and implementing **computer vision and ML algorithms**
- Evaluating classical and deep learning models for **image classification, object detection, and clustering**
- Building **scalable ML pipelines** for real-time automatic classification
- Designing and optimizing **modular software architectures**
- Implementing **frontend solutions** as part of full-stack projects

#### üåç Outside of Work
Beyond work, I‚Äôm passionate about **solving Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) problems** and continuously improving my **Python skills**. I also enjoy **hiking in nature, speedcubing and cooking**, which help me relax and stay sharp.

Let‚Äôs connect! üöÄ
